                <p> I'm a senior at Brandeis University in Massachusetts. My two great passions in life are creative writing and coding.</p>
                <p> 
                    I grew up in Somerville, and later moved to Harvard when I was around 10 years old. I have a sister, Clara Alexander, and a cat, Amber. In my free time,
                    I like to play video games, read, and write.

                    The ideals I value the most are hard work, curiosity, and family. I belive that almost anything can be acomplished if you are willing to put in
                    enough work to achieve it; this is something that both my parents have taught me. This is a value that I exercise every day in school and work.
                    When it comes to computing, you very often encounter bugs or issues that can seem insurmountable, but every time, if you are willing to put in the hours
                    you can find a solution to those problems. Curiosity is something my mom taught me. She tells me its best to live your life as a question mark, always
                    seeking out answers, always leaving room for further conversation instead of shutting the paragraph down. It's a poetic way of looking at things, but
                    there's a timeless truth at it's center regardless. It is very important to me that I ask questions about the world and always be willing to learn 
                    something new. Finally, family is the thread that ties this all together. It is from my mom and my dad that I learned to be a good person, learned how
                    to percieve the world around me, learned of my place in and the nature of the universe. My sister has helped me more times than I can count, and I know
                    I can rely on her when I need her most. My grandparents and aunts and uncles are all lovely people, and I enjoy speaking with them and visiting them very much.
                    I believe I have a duty to my family, to care for them and to love them and to protect them, just as they have done for me all my life.
