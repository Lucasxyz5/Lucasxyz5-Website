                    During my time at Brandeis, I've wrote many short stories (and other works) for one of the newspapers there, the Hoot. You can find my work here:

                <p>I also write a lot in my free time. I keep most of this writing private as much of it isin't very good, since I haven't taken the time to refine it.</p>
                <p>Here are a few stories that I've written, for you to peruse. Many of these are also published to the Hoot: </p>
